| keyword | explainations | current in use | e.g. |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| as |perform primitive casting, disambiguate the specific `trait` containing an item, or rename items in `use` statements | | |
| async | return a `Future` instead of blocking the current thread | | |
| await | suspend execution until the result of a `Future` is ready | | |
| break | exit the loop immediately | | |
| const | define constant items or constant raw pointers | | |
| continue | continue to the next loop iteration | | |
| crate | in a module path, refers to the root `crate` | | |
| dyn | dynamic dispatch to a trait object | | |
| else | fallback for `if` and `if` let control flow constructs  | | |
| enum | define an enumeration | | |
| external | link an external function or variable | | |
| false | Boolean false literal | | |
| fn | define a function or the function pointer type | | |
| for | loop over items from an iterator, implement a trait, or specify a higher-ranked lifetime | | |
| if | branch based on the result of a conditional expression | | |
| impl |  implement inherent or trait functionality | | |
| in | part of `for` loop syntax | | |
| let | bind a variable | Y | `let a = 1;` which mean variable a's value is 1 and cannot be changed|
| loop | loop unconditionally | | |
| match | match a value to patterns | | |
| mod | define a module | | |
| move | make a closure take ownership of all its captures | | |
| mut | denote mutability in references, raw pointers, or pattern bindings | Y | `let mut v = String::from("Hello world);`|
| pub | denote public visibility in struct fields, `impl` blocks, or modules | | |
| ref | bind by reference | | |
| return | return from function | | |
| Self | a type alias for the type we are defining or implementing | | |
| self | method subject or current module | | |
| static | global variable or lifetime lasting the entire program execution | | |
| struct | define a structure | | |
| super | parent module of the current module | | |
| trait | define a trait | | |
| true | Boolean true literal | | |
| type | define a type alias or associated type | | |
| union | define a union; is only a keyword when used in a union declaration | | |
| unsafe | denote unsafe code, functions, traits, or implementations | | |
| use | bring symbols into scope | | |
| where | denote clauses that constrain a type | | |
| while | loop conditionally based on the result of an expression | | |
